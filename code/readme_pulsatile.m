
% Toolkit for Pulsatile flow in arteries
%
% IMPORTANT > This toolkit is using some functions of Image processing 
% toolkit in matlab. Image processing toolkit is used to export dicom files 
% generated from the toolkit. If you need to export dicom files 
% this toolkit should also be installed.
%
% This toolkit includes a list of functions to provide pulsatile flow images  
% acquired from Womersley solution in the rigid tube. The toolkit includes  
% functions for exact solution of the domain for flow characteristics such
% as velocity, pressure, wall shear rate, volumetric flow and flow rate in
% the computational domain. Also there is a function to generate PC-MR
% images as numerical phantom for the domain. Fourier series for generation
% of temporal wave form are supported when pressure is given as: 
% p(t)=p0+Sum[pn(n)*exp(i*(2*pi*freq*t*n-phi(n))))].
